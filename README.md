## Standard LLD Problems Implementation.

    The huffman based file compressor is written for text files containing ascii and extended ascii characters from range 0-255. A sample text
    file 'sample.txt' is given as an input. The compressed file itself contanins the keys for decoding the compressed text. So any text file which
    is compressed to .bin file using this module can be decompressed to text file using this same module. To run the program use the main.py in
    huffman_compression folder.

    Rate Limiter for various algorithms have been implemented. The notes and necessary information is present in notes.text file. Execute the main.py file to run the program in Rate_limiter repo.
