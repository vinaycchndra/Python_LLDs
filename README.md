    1. The huffman based file compressor is written for text files containing ascii and extended ascii characters from range 0-255. A sample text  file 'sample.txt' is given as an input. The compressed file itself contanins the keys for decoding the compressed text. So any text file which is compressed to .bin file using this module can be decompressed to text file using this same module.
