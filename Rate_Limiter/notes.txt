1.  Rate limiting algorithms are implemented, the resources that I have used to understand the rate limiting algorithms are here:

2. The api gateways are the best places where we can plant the rate limiting endpoints since  the api gateways are used for the 
   authentication and routing of the requests coming into the system to the respectinve serving point.

3. So here at the authentication level we can identify the rate limiting since with the api key or the json web token we can identify the user and 
    can keep the track of the past request and current request for approving the request.

4. The token bucket algorithm fills the tokens to the bucket after every one third of the second. So accordingly refill tokens are calculated. 

5. Using asynchronous programming to run both the processes of generating requests and approving request in a single process. The two background processes one 
   for generating the request and other for filling the bucket in case of the token bucket algorithm implementation.
